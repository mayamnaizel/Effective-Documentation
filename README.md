## Why Documentation Matters

> “Good code is only as good as the documentation that helps people understand it.”

- Increases adoption & usability
- Onboards new developers faster
- Enables smoother CI/CD workflows
- Builds trust in open-source and internal tools
- Reduces tribal knowledge silos

##  Core Principles of Effective Documentation

- **Clarity over cleverness:** Write for the next person, not just for yourself.
- **Audience-aware:** Consider if the reader is a user, a developer, or an operator.
- **Consistent tone & structure:** Stick to a style guide (e.g., Google or Microsoft).
- **Update regularly:** Outdated documentation is worse than none.
- **Use examples:** Show real-world use cases or terminal commands.

## Documentation for DevOps Projects

In DevOps, documentation isn't an add-on — it's infrastructure.

### What to Include:
- **Infrastructure Overview** – Cloud architecture diagrams, provisioning flow
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – How code gets from dev to production
- **Monitoring & Logging** – Where to find logs, alerts, dashboards
- **Disaster Recovery & Rollbacks** – Playbooks for outages
- **Secrets Management** – How and where secrets are stored/rotated

> Tip: Store runbooks in version control and link them to alerts!

- **Endpoints** – Document all routes with:
  - Path, Method, Parameters
  - Example Request/Response
  - Error Handling

### Tools to Consider:
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- Postman Docs
- Redoc
